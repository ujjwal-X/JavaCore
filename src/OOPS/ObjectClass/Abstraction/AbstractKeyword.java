//Q Why abstract class contains constructor??
//Abstract classes can have constructors because they often need to initialize fields or perform setup that will be inherited by subclasses.
// Even though you canâ€™t instantiate an abstract class directly, its constructor is called when a subclass is instantiated. This allows the
// abstract class to enforce certain initialization logic and maintain consistency across its derived classes.

public class AbstractKeyword {
//    abstract void print();we cant write abstract method in non abstract class
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Bird b=new Bird();
    b.breed();//this will print nothing thats why there is no sense of making object of class which contains dummy methods

}


}
//Q why we use abstract class?
// An abstract class is mostly used to provide a base for subclasses to extend and implement the abstract methods and override
// or use the implemented methods in abstract class
